export const fatigueTheoryDesc = `The Goodman relation also called a Goodman diagram, a Goodman-Haigh diagram, 
 Haigh diagram or a Haigh-Soderberg diagram, is an equation used to quantify the interaction of mean and alternating stresses 
 on the fatigue life of a material. The equation is typically presented as a 
 linear curve of mean stress vs. alternating stress that provides the maximum number of alternating stress 
 cycles a material will withstand before failing from fatigue.
 A scatterplot of experimental data shown on an amplitude versus mean stress plot can often be approximated by a parabola known as the Gerber line, 
 which can in turn be (conservatively) approximated by a straight line called the Goodman line.`;

 In the table one can define input stress pairs and corresponding allowable cycles values. Cycle count should be within 1000 - 10,000,000 range.
 Please make sure that minimum stress value is less than maximum one. Also maximum stress level should be less than material's Ultimate strength defined in 
 Material Data section. You can define up to 50 stress points.
