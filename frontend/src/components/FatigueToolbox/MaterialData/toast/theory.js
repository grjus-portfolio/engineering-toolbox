export const ultStrDesc = `Ultimate tensile strength (UTS), often shortened to tensile strength (TS), ultimate strength 
is the maximum stress that a material can withstand while being stretched or pulled before breaking. 
In brittle materials the ultimate tensile strength is close to the yield point, whereas in ductile materials the ultimate tensile strength can be higher.
The ultimate tensile strength is usually found by performing a tensile test and recording the engineering stress versus strain.`;

export const fatigueFactorsDesc = `Fatigue testing of specimens provides the response of a material under ideal conditions. These
tests are made using a piece of raw material that is machined and then carefully polished. In practice, real parts may
have significantly less resistance to fatigue damage than the polished specimens used to determine the rotating bending
endurance limit. It is standard practice to account for material, manufacturing, environmental and design impacts
on fatigue life through reduction factors that are applied to the rotating bending endurance limit.`;
